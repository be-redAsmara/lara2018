This repository is intended to develop the work supported by the Latin America Research Awards 2018.

## Dataset

All images collected to build the datasets used in this work are public available at the following link:

[Coffee datasets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15YHebAGrx1Vhv8-naave-R5o3Uo70jsm).

* Our experiments using the symptom datasets combine our images with those available at https://www.digipathos-rep.cnptia.embrapa.br/. However, the public dataset above contain only the images we collect, but here on github you will find exactly what was used in the experiments.
